Problems with WooCommerce plugin "WooCommerce FedEx Shipping"

I am in the US. I have many customers in Canada.
I am useing WooCommerce as my shopping cart.
I am using the WooCommerce FedEx Shipping plug-in.

When a customer from Canada places an order, this plug-in queries FedEx for a shipping quote.
The correct quote consists of several parts: Base Rate, HST, Fuel Surcharge, Clearance Entry Fee and Residential Surcharge.
The problem is that the Plug-in only asks for the Base Rate. Thus the quote is sometimes as much as 40% low.
This is what the customer pays and I am left with two choices:
1) Either contact the customer personally to see if they want to pay more for their order, or
2) Pay the difference myself- which can be as much as 25% of the order amount.
Both of these options are bad.

Any ideas? I certainly cannot be the ONLY one out there with this problem. Anyone?
